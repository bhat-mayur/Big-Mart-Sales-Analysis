Overview:
This report analyzes data from a retail chain called Big Mart. It is an attempt to try and predict sales of products across the stores. 
It also gives overview of sales of products across the various stores. This report also shows the data in a visual format to better understand the various aspects of the stores and the products. 
Instead of using just one prediction model, we will be testing the performance of 7 models. Later, based on an ensemble of models (multiple models used by weights of each modelâ€™s prediction) a final model is chosen as the predictive model and used to predict the sales of each item at each outlet.
This is a prediction-based exercise where we try to predict the sales of each product in multiple stores.
The data contains attributes like item_weight, MRP etc. which help us to train a model for good accuracy.
